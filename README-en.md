# Vocational exams (EN)

The purpose of the repository is to:

- For me: learn the materials that will be used on INF.03 exam and to polish my webdev skills
- For others: get my solution to a problem that is presented in past E14, EE.09, INF.03 exams

**I don't guarantee that the solutions are correct.**

### **Order and frequency of publishing solved exams here**

The first exam is from January of 2015 from E14 edition.  
Next edition of the exam will be started when the current one is finished.  
Original idea is to publish at least one solved exam per week here.

### **Folder and file structure**

Direct children of the initial repository will be 3 folders - each is for a different edition of the exam.  
In each one of these folders there will be other folders - one for each exam. Their naming is the number of the month and the number of the year in which the exam took place.  
In these folders the file and folder structure will be the same as CKE desires in the exam tasks.  
Additionally, in each of these folders there will be a txt file with link to the original exam from [Arkusze.pl](https://arkusze.pl/technik-informatyk-egzamin-zawodowy/) website.
